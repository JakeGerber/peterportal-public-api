To get schedule of classes data, please use [this npm package](https://github.com/icssc-projects/websoc-api) made by one of our team members. This API allows access to school, department, course, and section data in a hierarchical JSON format. This module cannot be used on a browser as it uses a library called Camaro that uses features only available in NodeJS.

We are planning to integrate this package onto the API, but it's scheduled for future release!
